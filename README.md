# Amazon Vine Review Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize PySpark, AWS Databases, and PostgreSQL to perform ETL on Amazon Vine reviews. The data was extracted from Amazon S3, filtered and transformed into respective tables, and finally loaded into a PostgreSQL database via PySpark. Finally, the tables in the database were pulled and examined to discover if there was any bias in reviews of watches from Vine program subscribers. 

### Results
**Vine Reviews**
- There were a total of **47** Vine program reviews on watches.

- This amounts to 5-star ratings making up **32 %** of total Vine reviews.

**Non-Vine Reviews**
- There were a total of **8362** non-Vine reviews.

### Summary & Recommendations
The first thing to note in this analysis is the imbalance of total reviews between the Vine and non-Vine datasets. There are significantly more non-Vine reviews available compared to the Vine reviews. This gives us a better picture of non-Vine reviews data set, but there are not enough data points to draw any concrete conclusions about the Vine review data set. With only 47 total Vine reviews for watches this the sample size is too small to explore potential bias in 5-star Vine reviews. Therefore, it is inconclusive if there is bias. 

However, further analysis could be done if more Vine reviews could be gathered. Further, I'd also recommend filtering the data by "Verified Purchase" to ensure the accuracy of the results. This would ensure that reviews are, in fact, written by those who purchased the watches. If more data points are gathered for the Vine reviews, then a comparison of Vine to non-Vine reviews based on verified purchase would be helpful to determine if any bias exists for watches with Vine reviews.
